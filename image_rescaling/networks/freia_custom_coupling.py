        Additional args in docstring of base class.
        Args:
          subnet_constructor: function or class, with signature
            constructor(dims_in, dims_out).  The result should be a torch
            nn.Module, that takes dims_in input channels, and dims_out output
            channels. See tutorial for examples. One subnetwork will be
            initialized in the block.
          clamp: Soft clamping for the multiplicative component. The
            amplification or attenuation of each input dimension can be at most
            exp(Â±clamp).
          clamp_activation: Function to perform the clamping. String values
            "ATAN", "TANH", and "SIGMOID" are recognized, or a function of
            object can be passed. TANH behaves like the original realNVP paper.
            A custom function should take tensors and map -inf to -1 and +inf to +1.
